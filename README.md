# Unity-Bird-Game
#o What all the objects on screen are 
	There is a cute yellow flying bird waving wings and annoying endlessly random generated green pipes. 

o What their behavior is supposed to be 
	The bird is supposed to fall to the ground without player's control as well as move from left to right at a constant speed.

o What the player's controls are 
	The player controls Whitespace to push up the bird a little bit every single key down. Notice that there is a time interval before the player can push up the bird again. Also the player can control Escape to end the current round and reload the game.

o How the player scores 
	Every time the bird successfully flies through a pipe interval, the score goes up by 1. And there is a Record text stores your best record.

o How the game ends, including win/lose conditions, if appropriate 
	The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or touches the border of the screen and you lose. It's endless if you can somehow avoid any collision but you can always consider yourself win this round if breaking your record.
